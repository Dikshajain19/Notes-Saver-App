# ✨ My Paste App — Save & Share Notes Easily!

Hey there! 👋 This is a simple **Paste App** I built where you can:
- Save your notes
- Copy them with one click
- Share them via links  
…and just keep everything organized!


 📝 What You Can Do Here:
- Create new notes (I call them “pastes”).
- Edit or update your saved notes anytime.
- Delete: notes you don’t need anymore.
- Search: notes by their title.
- Copy : note content quickly to your clipboard.
- Share : your notes via a unique link.
- All your notes are saved in your browser (LocalStorage)—so they won’t vanish when you refresh!  



⚙️ Tech Behind the Scenes:
- **React.js** – For building the UI.
- **Redux Toolkit** – To manage the notes state.
- **Tailwind CSS** – For all the styling goodness.
- **React Hot Toast** – Those cool success/error popups.
- **Lucide Icons** – For clean, minimal icons.
